    <h2>About VuFind</h2>

    VuFind is a library resource portal designed and developed for libraries by libraries. The goal of VuFind is to enable your users to search and browse through all of your library's resources by replacing the traditional OPAC to include:
    <ul>
      <li>Catalog Records
      <li>Digital Library Items
      <li>Institutional Repository
      <li>Institutional Bibliography
      <li>Other Library Collections and Resources
    </ul>

    VuFind is completely modular, so you can implement just the basic system or all of the components. Since it's open source, you can modify or add modules to best fit your needs. A wide range of configurable options allow extensive customization without changing any code.

    <h2>Power</h2>
    VuFind runs on Solr Energy. Apache Solr, an open source search engine, offers amazing performance and scalability to allow for VuFind to respond to search queries in milliseconds time. It has the ability to be distributed if you need to spread the load of the catalog over many servers or in a server farm environment.

    <h2>Licensing</h2>
    VuFind is offered for free through the GPL open source license. This means that you can use the software for free. You can modify the software and share your successes with the community!

    <h2>VuFind in Action</h2>
    Take a look at our VuFind Installations Wiki page to see how a variety of organizations have taken advantage of VuFind's flexibility. If you are already using VuFind, feel free to edit the page and share your accomplishments.

      <b>"I love the 'text this' option in the catalog. It saves paper, I don't have to find the scrap of paper I wrote on, and I don't have to wonder if I transposed the call number. (I just have to have my cell phone with me!) This is a great feature."</b>
