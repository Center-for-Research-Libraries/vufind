# About the CRL Library Catalog


The CRL library catalog is powered by [VuFind](https://vufind.org/vufind/), an open-source resource portal built by, and for, the library community. VuFind works with [FOLIO](https://www.folio.org/), CRL's Library Service Platform, to deliver an enhanced discovery experience. CRLâ€™s technical teams and discovery experts have customized VuFind to preserve popular collection navigation scopes and familiar CRL features with VuFind modernizations, such as advanced faceting.

This CRL implementation of VuFind is also an open-source project accessible on [GitHub](https://github.com/Center-for-Research-Libraries/vufind), where you can see what platform enhancements and fixes CRL is [working on](https://github.com/Center-for-Research-Libraries/vufind/issues) or has [recently completed](https://github.com/Center-for-Research-Libraries/vufind/releases).

## Feedback
