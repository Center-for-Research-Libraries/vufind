# About the CRL Library Catalog

## New Catalog Launch

CRL launched this new Library Catalog in June, 2022. The new catalog is powered by [VuFind](https://vufind.org/vufind/), an open-source resource portal built by, and for, the library community. VuFind works with [FOLIO](https://www.folio.org/), CRL's new Library Service Platform, to deliver an enhanced discovery experience. CRLâ€™s technical teams and discovery experts have customized VuFind to preserve popular collection navigation scopes and familiar CRL features with VuFind modernizations, such as advanced faceting.

## Legacy Catalog Access

CRL's [legacy catalog](http://catalog-old.crl.edu) will remain available for a limited time as a courtesy to patrons making the transition to this new discovery experience.

## Feedback

While CRL continues to develop this platform we welcome comments and feedback from reviewers to [websystems@crl.edu](mailto://websystems@crl.edu).
