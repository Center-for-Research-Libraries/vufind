# About the CRL Online Catalog

## New Catalog Preview

This website is Beta preview of the platform that will replace [catalog.crl.edu](http://catalog.crl.edu). Like any pre-release software, it is incomplete and may contain bugs.

CRL's new online catalog will be powered by [FOLIO](https://www.folio.org/) and [VuFind](http://vufind.org/). This Beta release demonstrates these two systems working together to deliver an improved online discovery experience for CRL's collective collections.  

## Feedback

While CRL continues to develop this platform we welcome comments and feedback from reviewers to [websystems@crl.edu](mailto://websystems@crl.edu).
