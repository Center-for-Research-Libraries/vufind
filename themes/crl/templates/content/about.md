# About the CRL Online Catalog

## New Catalog Preview

**This website is a preview of the upcoming platform that will replace [catalog.crl.edu](http://catalog.crl.edu). Like any pre-release software, it is incomplete and contains bugs.**

CRL's new online catalog will be powered by [FOLIO](https://www.folio.org/) and [VuFind](http://vufind.org/). This "Alpha" release prototype demonstrates these two systems working together to deliver an improved online discovery experience for CRL's collective collections. Though incomplete, this prototype is sufficiently refined for self-navigation and early evaluation.  

## Feedback

While CRL continues to develop this platform we welcome comments and feedback from early reviewers at [websystems@crl.edu](mailto://websystems@crl.edu).
